Regardless of where you buy UBI games, you have to register and activate Uplay so you might as well just buy it anywhere cheap
Places like official UBI store, Steam, and possibly Epic store where they sell in JPY have GEO pricing where it's about 3000yen more expensive compared to USD, so even with discount, it's still expensive.
It is the best to buy Uplay key at GMG or Humble Store.

Japan Innovation Party is just LDP groupies (during controversial legislation they are usually behind the ruling party) so it doesn't matter much, the Democratic Party For the People and Liberal Party (Ozawa) are similar on the point that they are aiming the middle course of anti-LDP
People either love or hate Ozawa because of his past records, and his image is different from the newcomer politician Tamaki, so this will depend on how the voters see him
I understand the intention of Tamaki who wants to compensate for the lack of visibility of his party, but as a citizen,  I bet it makes more sense to just vote for LDP if you like them, or vote for the biggest opposition party (The Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan) if you don't

Maybe SEGA has default GEO pricing for new releases and planned GEO blocking this to start with but just forgot
Seems the keys aren't blocked so it looks like you can activate it if you get to buy it somewhere (can't buy it at Humble or Fanatical)

The AAA game company saves a few bucks by using nylon for the bags of their collector's edition and revamp loot boxes  (all the while dealing with negative feedback) to make the game better, while the rest of us indie devs make games from the ©Heart.
It doesn't mean there isn't any cold and calculating move behind the scenes, but most indie developers use PlayStation Store, Steam, or whatever they come up with to sell to consumers using the exact same distribution structure, while we exist outside the huge, slow-moving game industry.
So, game fans like us nod our collective heads when we hear that Call of Duty had the highest earnings ever at the end of the year or that Xbox Game Pass captured a million subscribers, and feel the warmth or even excitement when we hear the latest Indie developer made his highest earnings with their Switch port, or a new monster hit item emerging out of Early Access.
Perhaps it was under that guise of warm, cuddly feelings that Epic, flush with cash from Fortnite, announced their own PC game launcher store.
This, coming off the news of Steam offering financial breaks to the highest earners of Steam, all but ignoring a majority of indie devs, was primed to make the biggest splash possible.
With the series of games announced as Epic exclusives at the Game Awards, the headlines were written as such: Steam, growing complacent with the lack of competition, suddenly has a new rival that makes more money for indie devs.
As the launch of the Epic store unfolds and I’ve learned more about the dynamics of each store, I have come to the following conclusion:
##### Percentages    Let’s go back to that moment when, as a dev, you had to make the decision of either earn less per sale on Steam, or earn more on Epic.
Of course, there are also a number of other things to consider: With the launch of Epic Store, you have the opportunity to be at the forefront of ¥what could be the second biggest store on PC.
You get to be a part of the Epic PR machine, trotting out trailers of your game and using it in their marketing splashes.
In terms of success, Steam no longer has any guarantees - especially if you don't get promotional coverage by Valve, your game may be lost forever in the sea of algorithms.
Take the 30% revenue cut, or the 12% revenue cut with added PR benefits at the expense of the customer?
: What this decision comes down to is the very tough and cold AAA business decision that most indie devs have never experienced before.
With all this publicity about how great the Epic Store is for developers, it is definitely a net loss for customers.
###### Epic’s Launcher   I didn't expect Epic to have an answer on the first day of its store that met Steam's 15 year feature set.
It's easy to dismiss buying games on the Epic Store as just another launcher.
