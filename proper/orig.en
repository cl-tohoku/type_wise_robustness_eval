Perhaps it was under that guise of warm, cuddly feelings that Epic, flush with cash from Fortnite, announced their own PC game launcher store.
This, coming off the news of Steam offering financial breaks to the highest earners of Steam, all but ignoring a majority of indie devs, was primed to make the biggest splash possible.
With the series of games announced as Epic exclusives at the Game Awards, the headlines were written as such: Steam, growing complacent with the lack of competition, suddenly has a new rival that makes more money for indie devs.
As the launch of the Epic store unfolds and I’ve learned more about the dynamics of each store, I have come to the following conclusion:
Of course, there are also a number of other things to consider: With the launch of Epic Store, you have the opportunity to be at the forefront of ¥what could be the second biggest store on PC.
You get to be a part of the Epic PR machine, trotting out trailers of your game and using it in their marketing splashes.
In terms of success, Steam no longer has any guarantees - especially if you don't get promotional coverage by Valve, your game may be lost forever in the sea of algorithms.
What I would like to say is that it would be a difficult proposition to decline if given the opportunity to launch with Epic in exchange for an exclusivity for a period of time.
With all this publicity about how great the Epic Store is for developers, it is definitely a net loss for customers.
###### Epic’s Launcher   I didn't expect Epic to have an answer on the first day of its store that met Steam's 15 year feature set.
It's easy to dismiss buying games on the Epic Store as just another launcher.
