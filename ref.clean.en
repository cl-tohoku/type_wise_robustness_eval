The proposal to the developer is simple: earning 88% instead of 70%, complete with a curated store and access to the potentially second biggest audience on PC right now.
It’s a win-win for all the diligent indies, for the spirit of competition to make others react in business-friendly ways, and for gamers everywhere.
Not for customers, nor for the competition, nor for indie developers.
What I would like to say is that it would be a difficult proposition to decline if given the opportunity to launch with Epic in exchange for an exclusivity for a period of time.
They are getting a worse experience with your game.
I was expecting more than that.
