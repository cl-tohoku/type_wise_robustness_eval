They updated the description on the online store > The English version includes English voice. (Note that some events do not include English voice).
In law, either signature or ia seal should be fine (fuzzy on this), but in the real world, no one accepts anything other than signature + seal.
Don't force the seal upon us or there won't be curtailment! is the type of law I want.
Is this the one that was on a platform monopoly but now made available for other platforms?
2nd day I got destroyed for forgetting my homework in the morning
The fraud from January 2018 is a "new fraud" different from the fraud that was going on from 2004 to 2017. The report of the Special Commission of Audit has been written to justify that.
probably it's just today that we can get it virtually free...

Indie devs like myself are the scrappy underdogs that hide in the shadows.
It feels good when indies win, especially at a time where its never been more difficult to survive as a corporation.
The proposal to the developer is simple: earning 88% instead of 70%, complete with a curated store and access to the potentially second biggest audience on PC right now.
It‚Äôs a win-win for all the diligent indies, for the spirit of competition to make others react in business-friendly ways, and for gamers everywhere.
Not for customers, nor for the competition, nor for indie developers.
What I would like to say is that it would be a difficult proposition to decline if given the opportunity to launch with Epic in exchange for an exclusivity for a period of time.
They are getting a worse experience with your game.
I was expecting more than that.
